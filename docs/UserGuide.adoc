== Introduction

CAPTracker is for students who wants to use a desktop app for calculating and
managing their CAP (Cumulative Average Point). More importantly CAPTracker is
*optimized for those who prefer to work with a CLI (Command Line Interface)*
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can
type fast, CAPTracker is the ideal application for calculating your current CAP,
and predicting grades needed to achieve your ideal CAP in modules that hasn't
been taken. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `10` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `captracker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you would want to use as the home folder for
your CAP Tracker.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few
seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. Typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some commands you can try:

* **`c_add`**`-m CS2103 -y 2 -s 1 -c 4 -g A+` : Adds a module `CS2103` worth
`4` MCs taken in Semester `1` as a Year `2` student.
* **`c_delete -t CS2103 -e 2 -z 1` : Deletes `CS2103` taken in year `2` semester
`1` from CAPTracker.
* *`exit`* : Exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

`*Only one*` module entry have the specified target module code. +
_Pretty Print Format:_ +
----

    [-m NEW_CODE]
    [-y NEW_YEAR]
    [-s NEW_SEMESTER]
    [-c NEW_CREDIT]

----
*Case 2:* +
`*More than one*` module entry in CAPTracker has the specified target module
code. (E.g. Retook the module) +

    [-m NEW_CODE]
    [-y NEW_YEAR]

    [-g NEW_GRADE]
----

****
* Arguments must be in name-value pair format (E.g. `-name value`).
* Illegal name or value is not allowed.
* `TARGET_CODE` has to be specified.
* `TARGET_YEAR` can be null if and only if `TARGET_SEMESTER` is null.
* At least one of `NEW_CODE`, `NEW_YEAR`, `NEW_SEMESTER`, `NEW_CREDIT`, or
`NEW_GRADE` has to be specified.
* The targeted module entry should exist in the CAPTracker.
* `TARGET_YEAR` and `TARGET_SEMESTER` of the targeted entry must be specified
if there exist multiple entries with the same module `TARGET_CODE`.
* The edit cannot lead to two module entries sharing the same module `Code`,
`Year`, and `Semester`.
****

=== Saving the data

CAPTracker data are saved in the hard disk automatically whenever there is a
command that leads to change in the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== Understanding the User Interface
Understanding the User Interface can be tricky - what do all the different colours mean? How do I
know what has been saved or not? Where can I see new modules I've added?

* To view new modules you've added, scroll down to the bottom of the pannel that you have categorized your
module under; either the 'Completed Modules' panel on the left, or the 'Incomplete Modules' panel on the
right. Your new entry should be at the bottom of these lists.

* Understanding the colours. The grades of modules in the 'Completed Modules' panel on the left
are circled in GREEN. This indicates that this particular module has already been taken and this is
a grade that the user does not need to worry about; it is in the past.
The grades in the the 'Incomplete Modules' panel on the right  are circled in RED. This indicates
that this particular module has not been taken and that the grade displayed in this RED circle is
not certain. It is a grade that the user needs to be aware of as it's outcome will impact the
users overall CAP score.

== FAQ
