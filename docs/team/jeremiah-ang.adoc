== PROJECT: CAPTracker

---

== Overview

CapTracker is a desktop application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the *CAP & Target Grade Calculation* feature in Model.

** What it does: Calculates the current CAP of the user and also calculate the target grades the user have to achieve
in order to achieve their CAP Goal.

** Justification: This is one of the *must-have* User Story of the application,
to allow users to verify if they are able to graduate with their desired CAP Goal

** Highlights:
*** Correctness/Limitations of the algorithm are carefully thought of.
It may not provide the optimal solution, but it may very well be sufficient for students
to have a general sense of the feasibility of attaining their CAP goal.
*** Calculation of target grades are triggered when changes are made to the list of modules
in the transcript and updated on the UI.
*** Users may further adjust the target grade and obtain a updated list of target grades


* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added `adjust` command in Logic
** Added `goal` command in Logic
